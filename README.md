A loosely-coupled game engine to simulate pathfinding and graphical rendering

Uses Vulkan 1.2.170.0. Download here: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
Place a shortcut from the VulkanSDK folder to the root vendor directory

Also download the Vulkan Debug libs and extract them inside the VulkanSDK folder. (Used for auto shader compilation)

I need to fix some absolute paths in the source code :))
